# Intro
A process for diagnosing potential issues with a transformer using dissolved gas analysis (DGA) and sweep frequency response analysis (SFRA). Here is my interpretation:

## There are 6 main steps (C1 to C6).
- C1/C2 involve taking oil samples from the transformer and analyzing them using gas chromatography to detect fault gases.
- C3 uses the DGA results and checks them against predefined "normal" ratios to detect abnormal conditions.
- C4/C5 involve doing SFRA testing by applying voltage sweeps and measuring frequency response. This can detect mechanical problems.
- C6 uses the SFRA results to precisely detect any faults present in the transformer.

In other words
- There are 6 steps involved in the diagnostic process (C1 to C6)
- These steps can be arranged in any order to create different permutations
- The goal is to find the permutation that maximizes accuracy while keeping the cost close to a target
- Each step has defined inputs, tools, objectives, criteria, duration, etc.
- By rearranging the order of the steps, different permutations are generated
- Certain orders may produce higher accuracy or lower costs than others
- An optimization approach is likely needed to search the permutation space and find the ideal sequence
- Constraints like total cost and minimum accuracy thresholds need to be considered

For each step, there are inputs, tools/components used, objectives, criteria to check, duration, personnel required, expected accuracy, output type, and origin of the data.

The overall goal seems to be detecting faults in a transformer using DGA and SFRA in a systematic way. The accuracy and costs associated with each step are provided as criteria.
